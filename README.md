# AI Research Assistant – Mini Project

This project is part of the Open Deep Research internship task.  
It demonstrates how an AI model can generate sub-questions from a topic and then summarize them into one paragraph.

##  Objective
- Take a research topic from the user  
- Generate 3 simple sub-questions using an AI model  
- Summarize those sub-questions into a short paragraph  

##  Features
- Interactive input (user enters topic)
- AI-generated sub-questions (1 line each)
- AI-generated summary (2–3 lines)

##  Code Used
Python + OpenAI API

### Example Input
Enter your research topic: Impact of AI in Education



### Example Output
**Sub-questions:**
1. How does AI improve personalized learning?
2. What challenges arise from using AI in classrooms?
3. How does AI impact teacher roles?

**Summary:**
AI improves personalized learning, creates new challenges, and changes teacher responsibilities.



##  How to Run
1. Install openai library  
pip install openai


2. Add your API key in the script  
3. Run the Python file or Colab notebook
